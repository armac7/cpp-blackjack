# armac's Blackjack
## Created by armac (duh)

I'm fairly certain we've all had at least one game of Blackjack; however, it's one of my favorite card games personally. 
I've attempted to recreate it many times in the past, but due to my inexperience with coding it has always fallen flat.
This attempt, however, I feel as though I'm finally armed with the technical skill and know-how to make it possible.

As an aspiring Game Developer, I'm trying to get the hang of integrating new mechanics into an existing game, 
of which, if you run `armac-blackjack-v0.5.out` from `olf_versions`, you'll see what is essentially a completely
different game. No betting, worse UI, and, if you could see the code, unoptimized (or more unoptimized than it is now) code.

I'm still relatively new to C++, although not coding, so I'm still getting the hang of the language as well as other computer science
concepts. Here's a few things I want to work on via this project:
- **STYLE:** I want to cultivate a unique coding style to myself, as well as one which is efficient and easy to read. AS of now, I'm getting better; however, I still have far to go.
- **KNOW-HOW:** I feel like this goes for any project one may partake in; however, here especially, I want to not only understand but "know-how" to do things within a programming language.
- **UNDERSTANDING:** I want to deepen my understanding of computers, memory allocation, programming, and game design.
And a few others.

The last thing I'll go over here is version control. As of right now (10/27/23), there are only three versions of the program compeleted. Below is a list of them and their differences.
1. **v0.5** - This was the "first" version published to GitHub. It's rather barebones, sporting a basic (bad) UI and functional play logic; however, it is incredibly basic and, as I stated, barebones.
2. **v1.0** - By this rendition, I had added betting and bettered the UI at which point it became a better game; however, the code was not modular enough and inefficient in some areas (as well as bugs in others).
3. **v1.1** - The most recent release: this version of the game is the same as **v1.0**; however, it's sporting, again, better UI, more detail, better statics, and better betting. Betting was modularized, taken out of the main program and made into its own class, which made it much easier to use. 

I'm not sure when I'll stop making this program; however, I have other things I want to incorporate, such as a GUI and even other games. I have it set up in such a way where it would not be difficult to add other games to it. Maybe I'll add Poker next?

Regardless, thanks for reading.
